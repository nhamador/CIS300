              As an interdisciplinary artist, I work in several different mediums including painting, illustration, programmable art,
              and video art. Working in several mediums at the same time allows me to understand the specific boundaires of each one 
              and then play around and push those boundaries. Some of my favorite subjects are animals such as birds, frogs, and bulls.
              I like to play around in the region between abstract and not abstract art, using recognizable symbols and distorting them 
              to leave room for the viewer to interpret. I believe art is best when it is provacative but also vague and open ended 
              at some points, leaving room for many interpretations of the piece.
