    <p>I am currently studying at Arizona State University for my Undergraduate Degree. I was born in 
      Germany and moved around a lot as a kid and lived in Oklahoma, Hawaii, and finally Arizona. Some of my favorite painters are
      Elaine and Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon, Walter Battiss, and Graham Sutherland. I am currently exploring abstraction and
      how far I can distort a symbol before we have trouble grasping it. Some of my favorite painitngs look like 
      an almost complete mess at first, but the longer you focus on the piece the more it comes into focus.
